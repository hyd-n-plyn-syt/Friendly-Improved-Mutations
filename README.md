# Friendly Improved Mutations Mod

Just removes a few things from the mod [Improved Mutations](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1207623704) by [Eboreg](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Eboreg2/myworkshopfiles/?appid=333640&p=1) so that it will play nice with other popular mutation mods.

**Removed:** Flaming Ray/Freezing Ray, Poisonous Fangs, Scales, Snake Tail (and Constricted), and Thick Fur.

**Tested with:** [WM Expanded Mutations (Stable Edition)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2198787801), [Friendly Graven's Mutation Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3415333397), [Miscellaneous Mutations](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3114272414), [Poison/Paralysis/Confusing Fangs Mutations](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3400087527), [Underdark Mutation & Cave Dweller Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1727376332)

Do not use with the original unless you like crashes. All credit goes to the original mod author of [Improved Mutations](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1207623704).

If you'd like to contribute to any of my [public mods](https://github.com/hyd-n-plyn-syt?tab=repositories), or [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/hydnplynsyt), feel free!
